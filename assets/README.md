# assets

Inside this directory you will find scss folder which contains scss files divided by the main file, variables and fonts, is a good practice to separate them in diferent files
to help with modularity and readability.

If necessary, you can create another folder to store images ( if the image needs to be optimized by WebPack ).

EXAMPLE:
assets/
    ├── scss/
    │   ├── main.scss
    │   ├── variables.scss
    │   ├── fonts.scss
    │   └── ...
    └── images/
        ├── logo.png
        ├── background.jpg
        └── ...
